### Utilização dos Serviçoes de Saúde

+ Bolsa Família also increased the number of health
post visits for children under the age of seven years
(Additional file 1: Table S2). Participation in the program
increased the number of visits for growth monitoring
and checkups in 2009 by 0.6 and 0.2 visits, respectively
(p = 0.049 and p = 0.068, respectively). Bolsa Família was
not associated with a significant change in the number
of health post visits for older children between the ages
of 7-17 years. The study was unable to detect a signifi-
cant impact of Bolsa Família on visits to the health post
when sick, the urgent care center, or the hospital.
